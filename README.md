In this project, we aim to estimate the study room availability in libraries across the UNC-Chapel Hill campus at various times of the day. Through our investigation, we hope to find the trends and factors influencing the availability of study spaces on campus throughout the day.
We seek to provide insight into when the university and its students can expect to access study spaces, and how to handle room allocation in the future.
We will estimate the proportion of available reservable study rooms across campus at various times of day.
